# ``EdgeEngineDeveloper``

mimik Client Library for iOS provides a programmatic way to work with the edgeEngine Runtime to access information about the mobile device on which the application is running.


## Overview

The purpose of the **mimik Client Library for iOS** is to provide a programmatic way to work with the edgeEngine Runtime to access information about the mobile device on which the application is running, as well as mobile devices running within a cluster of mobile devices that are hosting the edgeEngine Runtime. Also, to allow developers to use edge microservices running within a particular cluster.

The **mimik Client Library for iOS suite** consists of these individual cocoapod components:

    - EdgeCore
    - EdgeEngineDeveloper (for developer projects) 
    - EdgeEngine (for enterprise projects) 

By leveraging the **`EdgeCore cocoapod`**, developers can build applications compatible with the edgeEngine Runtime.

Additionally, this component provides utility APIs that help developers with core operations such as Authentication, edgeEngine Runtime Setup, deployment of edge microservices and handling of network calls.

Furthermore, the **`EdgeEngineDeveloper (or EdgeEngine for enterprise projects) cocoapod`** provides edgeEngine Runtime lifecycle control API, as well as vendoring the actual edgeEngine Runtime binary into the iOS project.

Expanding the client library ecosystem is the **`EdgeService` cocoapod**, providing API for integrating mimik edge and backend microservices.


## Supported Platforms, Targets

* `iOS Mac Catalyst running macOS 12.0`


## Requirements
```
iOS 15.0+
```

## Installation

To install `EdgeCore` and `EdgeEngineDeveloper (or EdgeEngine for enterprise solutions)` cocoapods simply add the following lines to your Podfile:

> **_NOTE:_** Developers wanting to use their **developer edge license** from [mimik developer console](https://developer.mimik.com/console) should specify [EdgeEngineDeveloper](https://github.com/mimikgit/cocoapod-EdgeEngineDeveloper) cocoapod in their `Podfile`.

> **_NOTE:_** Enterprise project developers should specify [EdgeEngine](https://github.com/mimikgit/cocoapod-EdgeEngine) cocoapod in their `Podfile` and use the **full edge license** they received from [mimik support](https://developer.mimik.com/support/).


```swift
platform :ios, '15.0'
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

def mimik
  pod 'EdgeCore'
  pod 'EdgeEngineDeveloper'
  ### or pod 'EdgeEngine' (for enterprise projects, see the two notes above)
end

target '{target}' do
  mimik()
end
